	<article>Hey there! Thanks for looking at my site. I know, I know! I've been doing a little bit of everything since I graduated. Let me explain. After 2 years working in the financial industry and one year managing students at a college, I realized that the efforts to educate people on their finances is mainly geared toward those with money, and not those working to climb the ranks. Through the AmeriCorps VISTA program, I am currently creating a curriculum for students to understand and manage their finances--from high school, through college, and beyond!</article>
